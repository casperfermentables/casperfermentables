## About this site

MGLobel.com is a static site hosted on Github Pages for free. It's compiled and deployed using Middleman.

The portfolio modals are created with a simple Vue.js app. One of the more interesting elements I 
came across when putting this together was the 'v-if' helper. Using this helper, Vue.js only writes the HTML when the
view conditions are met (in this case when a user clicks on a project card). This keeps the DOM lightweight for the initial
load, only adding HTML as needed based on user actions.
