I enjoy creative problem-solving, efficiency, and self-empowerment. My most rewarding tasks are those that help people and organizations improve,usually by providing a better understanding of the tools of the modern age.

In my free-time, I practice Hapkido at Zen Fit Martial Arts and enjoy playing Star Citizen.
