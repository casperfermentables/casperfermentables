    <h2>Software Engineer / Product Manager</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>Four years ago I began learning 'how to code.' Initially it was just a way to grow
       our business, MyTennisLessons.com, but creating effective, focused software is now a passion and a
       craft that I try to spread as much as possible. My most rewarding tasks are those that help 
       people and organizations improve, usually by providing a better understanding of the tools 
       available in the modern age.
    </p>
    <p>I am currently available for part-time and fixed-scope projects. I specialize in helping 
      businesses find cost-effective and timely solutions for real-world problems. Contact me 
      today to start a conversation about your company's digital strategy for 2016.

    <hr />

    <h3>FULL-STACK MULTI-SITE MANAGEMENT</h3> 
    <p>
      Over the past 5 years I've helped guide and build the foundations for the MyTennisLessons 
      and FitnessTrainer platforms. From building our first sales CRM to hacking at experimental 
      features, I've had the pleasure of working on just about every aspect of our technology 
      stack. Currently I serve as the lead developer, managing our shared Ruby on Rails codebases and 
      coordinating new projects. In the past I've served in a variety of roles, from the first sales 
      person, to sales engineer, to product manager working with overseas contractors. I love being 
      able to touch so many different parts of the business, and finding ways to improve the efficiency
      of our marketing, sales, and operations teams. And of course finding ways to make our user's 
      experience the best-in-class.
    </p>

    <h3>E-COMMERCE SOLUTIONS</h3>
    <p>
      One of the core components for both of our sites is making it easy for clients to find a 
      provider in their area, add a payment method, and start scheduling. Payments are handled 
      using a custom Braintree integration, which has handled over $3 million in  sales over the 
      past three years. Once a client has an attached payment method, they can purchase packages 
      for coaches, monitor their order status and use the package for lesson credits. Providers 
      receive notifications about new bookings and can use their backend to schedule lessons from a
      booking. Our system also monitors and tracks providers receiving payment for lessons.
      The booking platform was one of the first features we developed, and I've worked with 
      numerous developers over the years to improve it and expand it's functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>RECURRING BILLING AND SCHEDULING</h3>
    <p>
      Last Fall I led an a development initiative to make one of the biggest changes to our scheduling 
      platform since it was first set up. We created an option that allowed for providers to charge 
      clients on a per-lesson basis. This involved a significant re-engineering of our upfront order-based system, but providing this option on the front-end doubled our online conversions over the fall and winter. We've removed it for our busy seasons, since many providers get filled up quickly during the spring and summer and prefer customer with pre-purchased packages during this time. 
      However the ability to add pay-per-session pricing is now an easy toggle and can even be enabled 
      on a per client basis for continued engagement after completing an initial package.
    </p>

    <h3>SALESFORCE INTEGRATIONS</h3>
    <p>
      Behind the scenes, MyTennisLessons and FitnessTrainer's operations rely on Salesforce to keep 
      track of our user-base and the health of our business. Our Salesforce integration lets our team 
      stay on top of potential clients, track instructor applications, and provides a data-hub for our 
      marketing integrations. In 2015 we integrated with Heroku Connect, making our Salesforce 
      integration incredibly easy to manage and allowing our Salesforce data to become a powerful 
      tool for new data-driven applications.
    </p>

    <h3>CUSTOM SEO ENGINE</h3>
    <p>
      The first version of our SEO engine was as bootstrapped as it gets. We had a Wordpress template 
      that we copied and pasted for each new city. Viola, engine made. But over time as we on-boarded 
      more providers and added new cities, it became difficult to manage the hundreds of pages. So in 
      2013 I led an initiative to create a dynamic SEO-engine.  Important things we had to consider 
      for an SEO engine were defaults and overrides for content and seo tags, CDN caching for maximum 
      performance, and ease-of-use by end users. Our first version was actually a static site generator,
      for ultimate page-load speed, but ultimately it was difficult to maintain and allow marketers 
      easy access, so we soon switched over to a Rails-based solution. That solution now powers 
      thousands of first-page ranked landing pages for tennis lessons and personal trainers across 
      the country, all with minimal developer involvement.
    </p>

    <h3>DYNAMIC GEO-SEARCH RESULTS</h3>
    <p>
      Every e-commerce site needs a strong search page to easily connect users with the products that matter 
      to them. We use Algolia to index all of our service-providers and deliver a quick and responsive search 
      experience. The initial implementation was set in place by our Lead Developer in 2014, Luke Wendling, 
      but since then I've used that framework to power email campaigns, custom recommendation pages, and 
      admin-search interfaces. Most recently I implemented a custom node script that can be used in Zapier 
      to find the closest 3 providers, which can then be used in marketing emails or other Zaps. Algolia 
      recently released a component library for search results, Instantsearch.js, that I've been testing on 
      side projects and hope to include on the MyTennisLessons and FitnessTrainer platform soon for a next-level 
      search interface.
    </p>

    <h3>EMAIL MARKETING SOLUTIONS</h3>
    <p>
      Over the past five years, email has played an important role in engaging our client and provider networks. One of the 
      biggest challenges we've faced is building dynamic drip campaigns that factor in the user's actions on the website, 
      sales person's interactions with the user, and the lifecycle stage of users in our signup process. Using Salesforce
      as a datasource for our marketing integrations has allowed us to bridge the gap between user autonomous actions and 
      sales-person interactions. Our marketing solutions have ranged from flat-out manual email sending,  custom Rails drip mailers, Customer.io, Mailchimp, 
      Hubspot, and Act-On, in a search to try and find the perfect balance of ease-of-access by marketing end-users and effective
      segment targeting. Today I'm happy to say we've found our best balance yet by using SendWithUs for amazingly easy to access 
      templates that work for in-app emails, drip campaigns, and marketing blasts. This allows us to change, test, and grow our email 
      templates, without costly code changes.
    </p>

    <h3>ADMIN USER INTERFACES</h3>
    <p>
      I've spoken with many people over the years looking to setup or currently running a marketplace, 
      and almost always I have to remind people about one of the most important users of the system..admins.
       A lot of focus  goes into the service provider and recipient user's experiences. But invariably any 
       marketplace service is going to have to play some sort of role in-between these two sides of the service. 
       Making sure that admin users can easily access important user data, see reports to understand the health of 
       the business, and provide quick and efficient support is essential to providing a best-in-class service. 
       Most of our admin interfaces are built off of ActiveAdmin, which is where I first learned to use Ruby on 
       Rails, and allow basic CRUD operations and a nice separation of concerns for any custom actions. More and 
       more though we've been moving admin functionality into Saleforce, and syncing the data using a combination 
       of Heroku Connect and custom webhooks with Zapier.

    <h2>Other Professional Experience</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>EmberScreencasts</h3>
    <p>
      This year I started helping our first lead developer Jeffrey Biles with his latest website, Emberscreencasts.com. 
      My primary role in the project was to manage the design and front-end development process and create a custom integration
      with Stripe. After completing the project, I'm a huge fan of Stripe's API and look forward to using it again on a project.
      Next up is a search page, powered by Algolia's new Instantsearch.js library.
    </p>

    <h3>ZenFit Martial Arts</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to being an active member of the <a href="http://zenfitaustin.com">ZenFit</a> gym, I've also recently started helping the business grow
      by adopting more effecient business technology. The first solution I've setup for them is an online sign-up for
      kids camps, taking advantage of Braintree's first $50K free of fees offer. The next project in the works is a student
      portal for managing membership and providing additional resources for current students. I also teach kids classes and 
      camps occassionally, which is always a fun time!
    </p>

    <h3>NationalField</h3>
    <p>
      In 2008 I worked for a political start-up <a href="http://nationalfield.com/">NationalField</a> (acquired by NGP VAN), after working on the Obama Campaign 
      at Northwestern University. It was my first introduction to a startup environment and taught me alot about how
      the entreprenurial world works.
    </p>

    <h2>Extracurriculars</h2>
    <hr />

    <h3>Hapkido / ZenFit</h3>
    <p>
      I've practiced the Korean martial arts of Hapkido for six years, four years at Yong Song Lee's Hapmudo Studio and now two years at ZenFit Hapkido. It's had a 
      tremendous influence on my discipline, and I try to incorporate aspects into my daily and professional life as often 
      as a can. Next up is Jiu-Jitsu..  
    </p>

    <h3>Star Citizen</h3>
    <p>
      Video games have always been an important part of my life. I began playing them at a young age with my father, and even wrote a 
      senior thesis on the topic <i>History as a Loaded Gun: American Exceptionalism in World War II First-Person Shooters</i>. My latest
      video game enthusiasm is the kickstarter based <i>Star Citizen</i>. The game has raised over $113 million in crowd-funding and promises
      an unprecendents open-galaxy approach. Amazingly the game has been playable throughout active development for over three years. When I'm not
      coding, practicing martial arts, or exploring Austin with friends, you can find me hanging out in a starship somewhere outside the Crusader planetary
      system.
    </p>

    <h3>Heidi Klum</h3>
    <p>
      On Christmas Day of 2011, our two founders Andrew Marcus and Jesse Silkoff met with a random vehicle in a grocery store parking lot
      and picked up a 9-month old boxer puppy. Her name had already been given by Austin Boxer Rescue, Heidi Klum. Since that fortituous day
      she has been our inspiration, our muse, our HR, and our reason. Would this company of five dudes living and working in a house together
      have worked without her? Who knows. But I think one thing we all know... #itsall4klum
