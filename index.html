      I enjoy creative problem-solving, efficiency, and self-empowerment. My most
      rewarding tasks are those that help people and organizations improve,
      usually by providing a better understanding of the tools of the modern age.
      In my free-time when I’m not traveling or otherwise adventuring, I practice
      Hapkido at Zen Fit Martial Arts and enjoy playing Star Citizen. I hope to
      have my own space ship one day. Until then, a self-driving car would do
      nicely.

      Foundational Readings

      Here’s some of the works that have influenced me along my journey to
      becoming a more effective human. They may not be the easiest reads, but
      were recommended to me by good people and will usually leave you changed
      afterwards.
