    Web and mobile developer based in Austin, TX.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy creative problem-solving, efficiency, and self-empowerment. My most
    rewarding tasks are those that help people and organizations improve their
    health and happiness, usually by providing a better understanding of the
    tools of the modern age. I was born in Houston,TX, raised in Potomac, MD,
    educated in Chicago, IL, and moved to Austin, TX, after a brief
    adventure.

  <p>
    Once there, I helped start, and currently work on,
    <a href="http://mytennislessons.com">MyTennisLessons.com</a>,
    and the occasional <a href="http://getmikeanddan.com">freelance project</a>.
    I also practice <a href="www.hapkido.com">Hapkido</a> at
    <a href="http://zenfit.com">ZenFit Martial Arts</a> and enjoy playing
    <a href="www.rsispaceindustries.com">Star Citizen</a> when not traveling.
