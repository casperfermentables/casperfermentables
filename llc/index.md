# Project-based software development and technology-focused business solutions.

Helping organizations keep a balanced approach to modern business tools since 2011.

My aim is to empower you to run, manage, and scale your business without the burden of
costly custom software buildouts. With the right recipe of cloud services, api integrations,
and a sprinkle of javascript, almost any business problem today can
be solved, at first, at a fraction of the cost of traditional software buildouts. Perfect for
rapid-prototyping and lean results in a fast paced software world.

And as an experienced business founder, I understand the importance of available resources,
timeframe, and long-term goals in creating a solution. From the first conversation, I’ll make sure
the focus remains on your organization and creating a natural extension to your current processes.

Services include:
- fast marketing and content sites   - custom salesforce development   - business process automation
- eCommerce setup and optimization  - custom seo solutions  - lead generation and optimization
- lightweight components and widgets  - api integrations  - technical debt review and solutions
          - ad hoc project management  - on-demand code review and pair programming  - internal business apps

Start a conversation by sending me some basic details about your organization and the problem(s) that you’re trying to solve.
